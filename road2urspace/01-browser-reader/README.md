>💁 If you're getting `Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP` error while opening the HTML with `file:///` protocol, just open and save the HTML file using a text editor, that should resolve the issue. Or, for a quick test, you can also use a browser add-on such as [CORS Everywhere for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/).
